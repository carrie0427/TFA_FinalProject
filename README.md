## Description ##

There are two ipynb files included in this project.<br /><br />

### Top10.ipynb ###
First of all, we import csv and pandas for later use. 
```
import pandas as pd
import csv
```
<br />

Then we read the csv file given and use dataframe to contain the data of our chosen zipcode.
```
df = pd.read_csv("311_Service_Requests_2020.csv")
my_zip = df[df["Incident Zip"] == 10036]
```
<br />

The next step is to group the data based on their "Complaint Type". We use `value_counts()` combined with `head()` to calculate the top 10 types of incidents in our neighborhood. `value_counts()` will return a Series in descending order by nature.
```
top10 = my_zip["Complaint Type"].value_counts().head(10)
top10.name = "Total number of incidents"
top10.index.name = "Incident type"
```
<br />

At last, we rename the name to "Total number of incidents" and the index to "Incident type" just for better understanding.
```
top10.name = "Total number of incidents"
top10.index.name = "Incident type"
```
<br />

**Validation:**
We would like to test if the type of top10 is `pandas.Series`.<br />
```
assert isinstance(top10, pd.Series)
```
No AssertionError is raised. So we could assume that the requirements are fulfilled.
